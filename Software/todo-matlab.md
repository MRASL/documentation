# MATLAB/Simulink

Matlab and Simulink can be useful tools for simulation and testing of your control algortithms. If you are not familiar with them, consider following some beginner tutorials:

* [Learn with Matlab Tutorials](https://www.mathworks.com/support/learn-with-matlab-tutorials.html)

## Implementation of Controllers using ROS

If you've developed a simulation for a robot you'd like to test, Simulink has some basic tools for subscribing and publishing to and from topics using ROS. To learn more, see the following tutorial:

* [Get Started with ROS in Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/examples/get-started-with-ros-in-simulink.html)

## Logic and Decision-Making using Stateflow

If you're testing a UAV in the lab, chances are you're going to switch between flight modes \(takeoff, landing, kill-switch, etc.\). Switching between these modes is possible using conventional logic gates and switches in the Simulink environment, but can become cumbersome and visually overwhelming very quickly. The Stateflow package enables a more intuitive implementation of mode-switching. To learn more, see:

## Toolbox licenses for MATLAB/Simulink

Our laboratory \(physically situated at L-5816 and virtually in VLAN24\) has the following reserved toolbox licenses for MATLAB/Simulink:

* 1 x [MATLAB Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder.html) \(note that the [Embedded Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/embedded-coder.html) toolbox may also be necessary sometimes when using [MATLAB Coder](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-coder.html)\)

* 2 x [Computer Vision](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html)

The usage status of all MATLAB/Simulink licenses owned by the Electrical Engineering Department is available [here](https://www.grames.polymtl.ca/en/facilities/servers-information/#toggle-id-9) in the section named "MATLAB \(Service Informatique\)". Search for "L5816" to quickly view who is using a specific license. You can also search using some keywords of a specific toolbox or known usernames. The list of licenses automatically updates at a fixed unknown frequency. To release a license \(or to pass it to another laboratory colleague\) simply close your MATLAB program. The released license can be taken by a new user simply by using any specific function to the released toolbox license. Users remain owner of these floating licenses as long as their MATLAB session remains active. Ask [Jean-Sébastien Décarie](mailto:jean-sebastien.decarie@polymtl.ca) regarding any problem/question using these licenses.
