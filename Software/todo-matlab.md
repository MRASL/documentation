# MATLAB/Simulink

Matlab and Simulink can be useful tools for simulation and testing of your control algortithms. If you are not familiar with them, consider following some beginner tutorials:

## Implementation of Controllers using ROS

If you've developed a simulation for a robot you'd like to test, Simulink has some basic tools for subscribing and publishing to and from topics using ROS. To learn more, see the following tutorial:

## Logic and Decision-Making using Stateflow

If you're testing a UAV in the lab, chances are you're going to switch between flight modes \(takeoff, landing, kill-switch, etc.\). Switching between these modes is possible using conventional logic gates and switches in the Simulink environment, but can become cumbersome and visually overwhelming very quickly. The Stateflow package enables a more intuitive implementation of mode-switching. To learn more, see:
