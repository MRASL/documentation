RCBenchmark

Installation procedure

This is a tutorial to safely use the[ RCBenchmark 1580](https://www.rcbenchmark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2016-02-04-RCbenchmark-1580-datasheet.pdf) in the laboratory.

1. Download the software for the [RCBenchmarkGUI](https://rcbenchmark.gitlab.io/docs/en/dynamometer/software/dynamometer-software-download.html).
2. Follow the tutorial for the installation of the hardware in the [RCBenchmark manual](https://www.rcbenchmark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Manual_Series_1580_1_12.pdf) \(step 1 to 6\).

3. Download the drivers located [here](https://rcbenchmark.gitlab.io/docs/en/dynamometer/software/troubleshooting-driver-issues.html). Then update two times the unrecognized drivers in Device Managers using the drivers just downloaded. 

4. Follow the instruction for the installation of the software in the RCBenchmark manual \(step 7 to 12\) BUT do not use the chrome app. Use the software downloaded at step 1. The chrome app seems to yield inferior results \(poor sample rate\) and has problems recognizing the USB port of the RCBenchmark. 



The signal sent by the software to the ESC is a PWM signal of frequency 50Hz and duty-cycle between 1/20 \(No throttle\) and 1/10 \(max throttle\). This signal has a tension between 0 and 5V and
