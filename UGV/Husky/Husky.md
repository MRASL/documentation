## Spare Parts

There isn't much available to us in terms of spare parts. The storage cabinets
have a few spare fuses at different ratings. DO NOT change the fuse rating (5A) on
the 5V, 12V and 24V rails. Theses fuses are accessible in the fuse panel in the
battery compartment. The higher amp fuses are meant to be put in line with high
loads connected directly to the battery.

## Custom modifications
In order to supply power to a Microsoft Kinect 2 during S.R. Manikandasriram's
mapping project, an extra 12V rail was required
