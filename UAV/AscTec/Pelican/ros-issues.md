## Issues to solve to run with ROS

* Fix ROS 
  * Due to the update of cmake to install glog, we lost some depencies the best would be to update all basics and reinstall the distribution \(Jade\) to start again with something clean and uptodate. A new distribution could be tested but nothing insure that it will work \(no support\). 
  * **Do not upgrade ubuntu, jade only works on 14.0**
  * Note that the pelican and the firefly use the same motherboard, an image of a working systeme could be useful.
