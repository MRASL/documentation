  * Simulation: successfull test of your own controller on GAZEBO
  * Packages installed
    * Firefly OBC
      * [asctec_mav_framework](https://github.com/MRASL/asctec_mav_framework): framework for data aquisition and position control to be used with the highlevel (HL) processor of Ascending Technologies helicopters
      * [MSF](https://github.com/ethz-asl/ethzasl_msf): Modular framework for multi sensor fusion based  on an Extended Kalman Filter

      * [VRPN Client](/Equipment/Vicon/Usage): connects to the Vicon server through the Virtual Reality Peripheral Network; provides position, orientation, velocity and angular velocity.
  * Power on
    * Asus router (WiFi network mrasl)
    * Netgear switch (2 TP-Link Wireless Access Points)
    * 2 Trendnet switches (Vicon cameras)
    * Firefly's FCU (flight control unit) with an ASCTEC battery fully charged (5000 mAh, 11.1V)
    * Firefly's On-Board Computer (OBC)
  * Vicon setup: see our [Vicon page](/Equipment/Vicon/Calibration.md) for more detail.

## Network Setup
 Remote monitoring and control the Firefly from a distance computer. In this tutorial, the desktop `L5816-18` and the object `firefly_blue` are used.

**IP address**: the remote computer and the firefly have to be connected to the **same network** (MRASL). The `firefly_blue` IP is [192.168.1.12](/Equipment/Networking/LAN.md). For this tutorial assume that the remote computer IP is **192.168.1.4**. You can check your IP address by typing `ifconfig` in a terminal.

**Remote monitoring and control of the Firefly from a distance computer**
  *  Check the connectivity between the remote computer and the `firefly_blue`  by running the following command in a remote computer terminal
```
$ ping 192.168.1.12
```
  * To log into the Firefly's OBC we use the following commands
```
$ ssh asctec@192.168.1.12
```
This command will open a ssh channel to the `firefly_blue` (default password is `asctec`). If you are using the desktop L5816-18, you can also running the permanent *alias* `$ connect_firefly_blue`.

  * We will use the `firefly_blue` as the ROS master, by setting the **ROS_MASTER_URI** and **ROS_IP** variables to the drone's IP. To change the variables we use the following commands in the remote computer terminal
```
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.12:11311
$ export ROS_IP=192.168.1.4
```
If you are using the desktop L5816-18, you can also running the permanent *alias*
```
$ master_firefly_blue
```

## Before your fly   
Setting up the ROS environment: don't forget to run `$ source devel/setup.bash` in each terminal before continue with the following subsections. If you are using the the `firefly_blue` and the desktop L5816-18, you can also running the permanent *alias* `$ gotien`.

**Firefly's OBC**
  *  If you want to implement your own controller, you should list and kill all default nodes on OBC by running the following commands
      ```
      $ rosnode list
      $ rosnode kill /AsctecProc
      $ rosnode kill /AutoPilot
      ```
  * Running `/fcu`, `/mv_26805107` nodes (Asctec Framework HL interface) and `/pose_sensor` node (MSF, private name)
    ```
    $ roslaunch asc_hl_interface fcu.launch
    $ roslaunch msf_updates viconpos_sensor.launch
    ```

**Remote Computer**
  * Running the `/firefly_blue/vrpn_client` node
    ```
    $ roslaunch ros_vrpn_client mrasl_vicon.launch
    ```
  This launch file is a copy of the original `asl_vicon.launch`, using for the `firefly_blue` object and the Vicon server IP [192.168.1.200](/Equipment/Networking/LAN.md)
  ```
  <arg name="object_name" default="firefly_blue" />
  <node ns="$(arg object_name)" name="vrpn_client" type="ros_vrpn_client" pkg="ros_vrpn_client" output="screen">
        <param name="vrpn_server_ip" value="192.168.1.200" />
  ```

After running these launch files, the `/pose_sensor` node may show this message (OBC terminal): `Pose measurement throttling is on, dropping messagesto be below 50.000000 Hz`.

# Init the filter
Open a `rqt` GUI in a remote computer terminal by typing `$ rqt`

Verify running nodes
  * Menu `Plugins/Topics/Topic Monitor`: check filter input/output data
    * Filter input from Vicon: topic `/firefly_blue/vrpn_client/raw_transform`, 250Hz
    * Filter input from Firefly: topic `/fcu/imu`, 100Hz
    * Filter output: `msf_core/pose` or `msf_core/odometry`, 100Hz
  * Menu `Plugins/Visualization/Plot`: plot the position, velocity, ...
  * Menu `Plugins/Introspection/Node Graph`
      ![](/assets/firefly_nodes.png)

**Init the filter**
  * Menu `Plugins/Configuration/Dynamic Reconfigure`
    * `fcu/fcu`: chose `POSCTRL_OFF` for `position_control` and `STATE_EST_OFF` for `state_estimation`
    * `pose_sensor/pose_sensor`: click on `core_init_filter`
  * Move the drone and check

  ![](/assets/firefly_nodes2.png)

After init the filter, the `/pose_sensor` node has to show a message (OBC terminal) as: `initial measurement pos:[ 0.158259 0.0267092  0.754158] orientation: [0.998, 0.00129, 0.025, 0.0552]` and some other messages.

## Running the demos   
**Before running the controller**
  * RVIZ and RQT
  * Check our [Safety](/UAV/Safety) page
  * Remote control
  * Start the motors


**Running the controller**
  * Running the controller node by typing the following command in a Firefly's OBC terminal
    ```
    $ source devel/setup.bash
    $ roslaunch gstf_control lqr_controller.launch
    ```
  * Menu `Plugins/Introspection/Node Graph`: check node
  * **Check the data before active the controller**
  Topic `/firefly/command/motor_speed/angular_velocities` and `/firefly/command/motor_speed/normalized` should **have to be `0.0` for all components**.
  * Active the controller: change the remote control to autopilot


**Send the reference**
menu `Plugins/Topics/Message Publisher`
  * Add the topic `/firefly/command/pose` by using the button `+`
  * Change the value of `pose/position/z` to `0.5`
  * Check the box to publish


**Verify the result**
menu `Plugins/Topics/Topic Monitor`
  * Command: topic `/firefly/command/motor_speed/angular_velocities` and `/firefly/command/motor_speed/normalized`
  * Output:
