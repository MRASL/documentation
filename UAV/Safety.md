# General Safety Instructions

* Friends don't let friends get close to spinning propellers.
  * **NEVER** Approach a multicopter whose propellers are still in motion.
* A safety pilot must always be present and he must have the training and ability to fly the UAV manually in any situation.
* Do not fly over people or close to people. The safest spot for spectators is usually behind the pilot.
* Always wear protective gear (safety goggles) and stay behind the net.
* In case of any unexpected behavior, the pilot must immediately take back control the multicopter.
  * When testing new algorithms such as navigation and control algorithms, a spotter should narrate out loud for the safety pilot the expected behavior of the vehicle. e.g. "The quad will now go left two meters."
* When having a new or changed setup (new/other controller, different parameters etc), carefully check the expected outputs before flying.
  * You can do this by removing the propellers and moving the vehicle around manually and checking what the controller command is.

# Before you fly checklist (indoors)
* Is the battery fully charged?
  * Even if it is partially charged, unexpected voltage drops can occur for a partially charged battery left out for a long time. Charge your batteries before flight.
* Is the remote control fully charged?
* Is the safety pilot present and alert?
* Are all propellers placed in the correct orientation?
* Are all propellers secured to their motor?
* Are all propellers intact?
  * Never fly with a cracked propellers or even a propeller with only light damage. Cheaper propellers can shatter at high RPM after sustaining light damange.
* Are all motors intact?
  * After a crash sometimes the shaft of a motor can be crooked or ball bearings will won't be fluid which will degrade performance and can lead to ESCs overheating.
* Are all screws, nuts and bolts tightened and secure?
* Are all the nets closed up around the flight zone?
* Is there magnetic interference in the vehicle's takeoff position?
  * The M100 will signal this on its status light.
* Is the wireless signal clear?
  * If you are using Wifi to transmit Vicon data, can you correctly and consistently ping  your vehicle with low latency?
* Are all the mattresses on the floor?

# Before flying (outdoors)
In addition to the above:
* Are you sure you have permission to fly here? Check Transport Canada rules. If flying in the parking lot, get proper authorization before you get harassed by campus security.
* Do you have proper GPS reception/a good number of satellites?
* Are there any people around?
  * Abort flight immediately if you see unauthorized personnel approaching.
* Do you have a spotter?
  * Never fly alone outside. Keep someone with you on the lookout for civilians and to monitor flight data.
