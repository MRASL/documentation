# WiFi equipment

The lab has the following Wifi equipment:

* Asus RT-AC55U (or similar) Dual band router
* Ubiquity Unifi AP Outdoor
* Ubiquity AirMax Omnidirectional 2x2 antenna (high gain)

## General notes on usage

* Always shutdown wifi equipment when you're done with it. Technically we aren't allowed to operate our own WiFi network.
* For some reason, the Asus router's wifi connection is a bit flimsy. We usually simply use it as a router.
